# Tabletop Simulator Lua Integration for VSCode

Visual Studio Code extension for Tabletop Simulator Lua development, based on the [official Atom extension](https://github.com/Berserk-Games/atom-tabletopsimulator-lua).

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `ttslua.communicationMode`: Configures whether the extension should communicate with the game, and if so which files should be automatically opened in the editor when received from the game.
    * `all`: All files are automatically opened.
    * `global`: Only the global files are automatically opened.
    * `none`: No file is automatically opened.
    * `disabled`: Disable communication with the game.
* `ttslua.createXml`: When enabled, the extension will automatically create an XML UI file when an object is sent from the game

## Known Issues

Calling out known issues can help limit users opening duplicate issues against your extension.
